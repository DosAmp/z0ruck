# z0ruck – A simple frontend to z0r.de
Originally written to allow me to watch my offline copy of the [z0r.de](http://z0r.de/) flash loop collection in a more comfortable environment, **z0ruck** [ʦoˈʀʏk] is a little JS script for those who are fed up with their current site that has become cluttered with social network features, rarely useful comments and ads.

## How to use
1. Edit **z0ruck.js** and change the `flashpath` variable (line 66) to reflect the file name format of your mirror. For example, if you leech your mirror directly off z0r and put it in the same directory with the script without renaming the files, this would be:

   ```js
   var flashpath = "z0r-de_" + curflashloop + ".swf";
   ```
2. Rename **flashcount.js.example** to **flashcount.js** and set the constant `TOTAL_FLASH_COUNT` to the count of flash loops available (including the zeroth!). This can be found from <http://z0r.de/info>, [z0r's Twitter timeline](https://twitter.com/z0rde) or something like `ls -1f *.swf | wc -l`.

## Other advice
You may want to add the directory the flash loops are located in as a [trusted location](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/093/4c093f20.html) in the Adobe Flash Settings Manager (or Control Panel applet under MS Windows) to avoid security warnings when watching them locally.
