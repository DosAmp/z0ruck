z0ruck [ʦoˈʀʏk] – A simple frontend to z0r.de

Originally written to allow me to watch my offline mirror of the z0r.de flash
loop collection in a more comfortable environment, I'm sharing this little JS
script for those who are fed up with their current site that suffers from a
common disease: Trolls and song askers spamming the comments and buttons for
more or less known social networks taking away precious screen space.

HOW TO USE

1. Edit z0ruck.js and change the flashpath variable (line 66) to reflect the
   file name format of your mirror. For example, if you leech your mirror
   directly off z0r and put it in the same directory with the script without
   renaming the files, this would be:

      var flashpath = "z0r-de_" + curflashloop + ".swf";

2. Rename flashcount.js.example to flashcount.js and set the constant
   TOTAL_FLASH_COUNT to the count of flash loops available (including the
   zeroth!). This can be found from http://z0r.de/info or something like
   `ls -1f *.swf | wc -l`.

You may want to add the directory the flash loops are located in as a trusted
location in the Adobe Flash Settings Manager (or Control Panel applet under
MS Windows) to avoid security warnings when watching them locally:
